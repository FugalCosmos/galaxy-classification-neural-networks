# galaxy-classification-neural-networks
10-class classification of galaxy images using neural network prototypes.

NOTE:

I was unable to save and load the histories of the previous analyses involving the full dataset, therefore I have substituted the images of those outputs.

Future improvements to this notebook will involve figuring out how to do so.
